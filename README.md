# AutoCAIN_batch
Batch script to run CAIN

## Requirements (All need to be in the same folder as the .bat)

ffmpeg

cain ncnn vulkan (https://github.com/nihui/cain-ncnn-vulkan/actions)

## How to use it:
Just run the .bat imao and answer what the program asks

There is also a .bat that deletes the cache if you are too lazy to do it yourself

Also, I included a .bat that works as drag and drop (a real AutoCAIN), but it doesn't works for now. It only works with videos and it doesn't output audio

## To do list:

-Optimize the code

-Make AutoCAIN detect if input is gif or mp4

-Make "run CAIN" detect the framerate and 2x, 4x or 8x it in the %fps% value

-Add option to select output folder in ftv

-Maybe add option to select an output folder like DAIN-APP

-Maybe add support to input frames folder

-Add option to input your own cain extra argumments
or more options indeed

-Add option to input your own ffmpeg command in ftv
or more options indeed

-Implement a menu in general
